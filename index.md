# Motivation
There are emerging demands on integrating various techniques as well as social intelligence to solve various social issues, such as increasing/decreasing of populations, consensus building among people having conflicting preferences, etc. Although many AI-based heuristic approaches have been applied for them, to make reasonable and agreeable decisions and actions to such issues, to make an ability to better explain what and why of those decisions as well as the processes to reach them are crucial. On the other hand, mechanism design, social choice, and other agent-based technologies such as automated negotiation among intelligent software agents are now being very strong tools and theories to make the systems intelligent. To make their behaviors explainable and understandable for us, giving a good grounding to facts, knowledge, and data is crucial. Because the only workable standard for describing them are ontology-based reasoning with Linked Open Data that the conference attendees have been developed, we are having strong interest from researchers working on such AI and agent-based technologies. This workshop can promote the state-of-the-art techniques and platforms to those people as well as attendees of this conference and to give a chance to meet them and emerge collaborations.
