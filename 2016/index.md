# Motivation
There are emerging demands on integrating various techniques as well as social intelligence to solve various social issues, such as increasing/decreasing of populations, consensus building among people having conflicting preferences. Although many AI-based heuristic approaches have been applied for them, to make reasonable and agreeable decisions and actions to such issues, to make an ability to better explain what and why of those decisions as well as the processes to reach them are crucial. On the other hand, mechanism design, social choice, and other agent-based technologies such as automated negotiation among intelligent software agents are now being very strong tools and theories to make the systems intelligent. To make their behaviors explainable and understandable for us, giving a good grounding to facts, knowledge, and data is crucial. Because the use of ontology-based reasoning techniques with Linked Open Data is now going to be a great platform to describe and manage them, this workshop also welcomes contributions from researchers working on  AI and agent-based technologies field. This workshop aims to promote state-of-the-art techniques and platforms to those people and to provide an opportunity to emerge good collaborations among them.
