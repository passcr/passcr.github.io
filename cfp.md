There are emerging demands on integrating various techniques as well as social intelligence to solve various social issues, such as increasing/decreasing of populations, consensus building among people having conflicting preferences, etc. For example, Ito et al. presented a consensus building application Collagree [[Ito 2014]](#ito2014) that incorporates incentive control techniques as well as aggregating ideas and making structural views of them. Although many AI-based heuristic approaches have been applied for them, to make reasonable and agreeable decisions and actions to such issues, to make an ability to better explain what and why of those decisions as well as the processes to reach them is crucial. The organizers believe that, ontology and reasoning technologies can be a key component for that, and building platforms [[Yamaguchi 2015]](#yamaguchi2015) and testing them on various applications will be great help to emergence and reinforcement of such technologies. 

Also, mechanism design, social choice, and other agent-based technologies such as automated negotiation among intelligent software agents are now being very strong tools and theories to make the systems intelligent. To make their behaviors explainable and understandable for us, giving a good grounding to facts, knowledge, and data are crucial. Since the ontology-based reasoning techniques with Linked Open Data are going to be a great platform for it, this workshop also welcomes contributions from researchers working on AI and agent-based technologies. This workshop aims to promote state-of-the-art techniques and platforms to those people and to provide an opportunity to emerge good collaborations among them.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 

* collective reasoning 
* collective intelligence 
* knowledge management
* ontology-based reasoning platform 
* social and large scale consensus support 
* open government data 
* civic tech applications 
* negotiation technology 
* applications of ontology and reasoning for social issues 
* computer-supported cooperative work 
* tools and techniques for efficient and easier LOD access with inference 
* applications of platforms (e.g., to robotics, social consensus building, etc.)
